## Story
There are squids and octopi everywhere. This is a problem.

## Gameplay
The gameplay is based on the Katamari Damacy games, where the player rolls a sticky ball over objects, making that ball bigger so they can roll up larger objects until some goal is met. To adapt this to 2D, there will be a limited area of play with squids of different sizes at random locations. As a stretch goal, obstacles and moving squids could be added to increase complexity. The player is motivated by reward of getting bigger and being able to roll up bigger squids. Squids that haven't been rolled up create ink on a timer, and if the stage is covered in ink, it is game over, so the player is motivated to go quickly. 

## Controls
Player movement is controlled by both WASD and the arrow keys, based on the controls of the Katamari games. To move in a direction, both keys for that direction must be held (W and up for up, A and left for left, etc.) Holding one direction key turns the character to face another direction.

## Aesthetics and Sound
Cutesy, simple graphics. Cute, bubbly music and sound effects for rollup.
